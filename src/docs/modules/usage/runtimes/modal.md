# Modal Runtime

Our partners at [Modal](https://modal.com/) have provided a runtime for TeAI.

To use the Modal Runtime, create an account, and then [create an API key.](https://modal.com/settings)

You'll then need to set the following environment variables when starting TeAI:
```bash
docker run # ...
    -e RUNTIME=modal \
    -e MODAL_API_TOKEN_ID="your-id" \
    -e MODAL_API_TOKEN_SECRET="your-secret" \
```
